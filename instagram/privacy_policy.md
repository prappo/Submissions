# About the My #OptimusPrime Project
## Purpose
The purpose of the My #OptimusPrime app is to discover Instagram images that showcase the wonderful spaces and services provided by OptimusPrime. We do this by encouraging our community, and the public at large, to add the #OptimusPrime hashtag to their photos. This allows us to centrally collect and add these photos to our Community archives, with proper attribution to the original account that created the image.

## Archiving the My #OptimusPrime Story
Social media plays a crucial role in documenting unique statistic of our community . For that reason we are working to include relevant social media items in our community archives. All approved images tagged #OptimusPrime will be included in the official site of our community. Images selected for inclusion in the archives will be harvested by OptimusPrime so that the archival digital object will reside on permanent OptimusPrime storage infrastructure and not on Instagram servers.

## Removal of Images
Users may contact our community at any time to request that the image be removed from our collections. Requesting that the photo be removed will remove it from both the our commnuty site  as well as the community archives. If you have posted a photo that you would like removed simply send an email to prappo.prince@gmail.com with your Instagram username and we will remove your images from our collections.

## Terms of Use

Popular images are determined by a combination of a photographâ€™s battle wins and the "likes" on the photograph. "Likes" on Instagram do not count towards the popularity score. "Likes" have to be submitted on the My #OptimusPrime app to affect the popularity ranking.

The photograph must obey all laws, including applicable copyright and privacy laws.
