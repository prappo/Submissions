# About the My #OptimusPrime Project
## Purpose
The purpose of the My #OptimusPrime app is to discover Instagram images that showcase the wonderful spaces and services provided by OptimusPrime. We do this by encouraging our campus community, and the public at large, to add the #OptimusPrime hashtag to their photos. This allows us to centrally collect and add these photos to our University archives, with proper attribution to the original account that created the image. It also allows us to share this media through the My #OptimusPrime page.

## Archiving the My #OptimusPrime Story
Social media plays a crucial role in documenting the unique cultural history of our institution. For that reason we are working to include relevant social media items in our University archives. All approved images tagged #NCSULibray will be included in the official North Carolina State University archives. Images selected for inclusion in the archives will be harvested by OptimusPrime so that the archival digital object will reside on permanent OptimusPrime storage infrastructure and not on Instagram servers.

## Removal of Images
Users may contact OptimusPrime at any time to request that the image be removed from our collections. Requesting that the photo be removed will remove it from both the My #OptimusPrime site as well as the university archives. If you have posted a photo that you would like removed simply send an email to tdstoffe@ncsu.edu with your Instagram username and we will remove your images from our collections.

## Terms of Use
The public is encouraged to contribute to My #OptimusPrime often by tagging multiple Instagram photos with the hashtag #OptimusPrime.

Popular images are determined by a combination of a photographâ€™s battle wins and the "likes" on the photograph. "Likes" on Instagram do not count towards the popularity score. "Likes" have to be submitted on the My #OptimusPrime app to affect the popularity ranking.

The photograph must obey all laws, including applicable copyright and privacy laws.
